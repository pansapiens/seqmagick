We often have to convert sequence files between formats and do little
manipulations on them, and it's not worth writing scripts for that.
``seqmagick`` is a kickass little utility to expose the file format conversion
in BioPython in a convenient way.  Instead of having a big mess of scripts,
there is one that takes arguments::

    seqmagick convert a.fasta b.phy    # convert from fasta to phylip
    seqmagick mogrify --ungap a.fasta  # remove all gaps from a.fasta, in place
    seqmagick info *.{fasta,sto}       # describe all FASTA and Stockholm
                                       # files in the current directory
    seqmagick protparam a.fasta        # output masses and predicted 
                                       # isoelectric points

Features include:

* Modifying sequences: Remove gaps, reverse complement, reverse, change case,

  - Remove gaps
  - Reverse & reverse complement
  - Trim to a range of residues
  - Change case
  - Sort by length or ID (or mass or pI)
  - `more <http://fhcrc.github.com/seqmagick/#convert-and-mogrify>`_

* Displaying `information <http://fhcrc.github.com/seqmagick/#info>`_ about
  sequence files
* Subsetting sequence files by:

  - Position
  - ID
  - Deduplication
  - `more <http://fhcrc.github.com/seqmagick/#convert-and-mogrify>`_

* Filtering sequences by `quality score
  <http://fhcrc.github.com/seqmagick/#quality-filter>`_
* Trimming alignments to a `region of interest
  <http://fhcrc.github.com/seqmagick/#primer-trim>`_ defined by the
  forward and reverse primers
